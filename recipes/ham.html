        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This ham is easy, loved by all, and requested every year for Christmas and Easter. 
        Thats a winning recipe in my book! For this version, I added a little ground clove to 
        the sugar, and I skipped the cherries, but feel free to add them if you want to go retro.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (12 pound) bone-in ham </li>
            <li>1/2 cup whole cloves </li>
            <li>1 (20 ounce) can pineapple rings in heavy syrup </li>
            <li>1/2 cup packed brown sugar </li>
            <l1>1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle lemon-lime flavored carbonated beverage </l1>
            <li>1 (4 ounce) jar chopped maraschino cherries </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place ham in a roasting pan. Score the rind of the ham with a diamond pattern. Press a clove into the center of each diamond. Drain the juice from the pineapple rings into a medium bowl, and stir in the brown sugar and lemon-lime soda. Coat the ham with this mixture. Arrange the pineapple rings over the outside of the ham. Place a maraschino cherry in the center of each pineapple ring, and secure with a toothpick.</li>
            <li>Bake uncovered for 4 to 5 hours, basting frequently with the juices, until the internal temperature of the ham is 160 degrees F (72 degrees C). Be sure the meat thermometer is not touching the bone. Remove toothpicks before serving.</li>
        </ol>
